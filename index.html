                    Trolleybuses have been a part of Wellington public transport since 1949. In the city, over 80 kilometres of wire cover roughly 50 kilometres of bus routes. 3500 poles hold up these wires, with 90% of the poles also being used for other infrastructure, such as communications and electricity supply.

Over 190 electronic display signs are installed at key bus stops in Wellington, with another 60 at train stations. RTI is available on the Metlink website - by simply searching up your stop or station, and can also be found through the Metlink app.

                    A digital image is taken with speed cameras when an offence is detected. These images are stored digitally and cannot be overwritten or altered, with a security detector preventing any attempt to tamper with the image. Any relevant information, such as time/date/location, is also encrypted. Wellington's  Ngauranga Gorge camera raked up over 14,200 tickets in 2015, equating to $1.07 million in fines.

                    Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras operate in Central Wellington in partnership with the Police. The camera base is located at the Wellington Central Police Station where volunteers help monitor footage from several cameras simultaneously. Transdev also boasts over 650 cameras in their security network in Wellington train stations, park and ride areas, railyards and trains, that deliver real time footage through fibre optic cables to a central hub.

                    Traffic Controls <br>
                    Across New Zealand, 'linked traffic signals' controlled by SCATS (Sydney coordinated adaptive traffic systems) ensures the most efficient movement of traffic across a network of intersections. Alongside this, 'variable mandatory speed control signs' aim to reduce traffic before queues from by reducing traffic speeds. And 'electronically changeable signs' provide messages about what's happening on the roads ahead.

                    Pedestrian Crossings <br>
                    Pedestrian signals in Wellington often include a push button that needs to be used to initiate a signal cycle with the surrounding traffic lights. These signals are timed and operate simultaneously for smooth traffic control for both the pedestrian and the driver.
